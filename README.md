This project provides a simple command-line interface to demonstrate the implementation and basic operations of multiple fundamental data structures and algorithms in C++. It is designed as a learning tool to help users understand how these data structures work internally.

Features
Insertion Sort: Demonstrates sorting an array using the insertion sort algorithm.
Sequential Search: Demonstrates searching an element sequentially in a collection.
Stack Operations: Shows basic stack operations like push, pop, and peek.
Queue Operations: Demonstrates enqueue and dequeue operations on a queue.
Linked List: Implements and showcases singly linked list operations.
